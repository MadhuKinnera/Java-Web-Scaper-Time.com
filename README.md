# Java Web Scraping and REST API Project

**Author:** Madhu Kinnera

## Overview

This project is a simple Java application that performs web scraping on [TIME.com]([https://time.com](https://time.com/search/?q=stories)) to fetch the top 6 stories and exposes the scraped data as a REST API. The application is built entirely in plain Java using the `java.net` and `java.io` packages, without any external frameworks. The web server runs on port **8000** and serves the scraped content in JSON format.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Extracts the top 6 stories from TIME.com using Java's `java.net` package.
- **REST API**: Exposes the scraped data as a REST API that can be accessed via `localhost:8000`.
- **JSON Response**: Returns the scraped data in a structured JSON format.
- **Simple HTTP Server**: Implements a basic HTTP server using `ServerSocket` and `Socket` from the `java.net` package.

## Project Structure

- **dtlassignment/com/dtl/ResponseServer**: The main entry point for the application, responsible for starting the HTTP server and handling HTTP requests.
- **dtlassignment/com/dtl/JSONResponse**: Contains logic for web scraping using Java's `java.net` package and string manipulation to parse HTML content.
